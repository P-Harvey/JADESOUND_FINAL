### General Info and Motivation
The overview and motivation for this project and the subsequent questions is to focus on potential risk factors that are correlated with mental health issues. 
By specifically focusing on socioeconomic attributes, we intend to identify meaningful correlations between these attributes and mental health prior to and during the pandemic. 
If successful, this will allow us to quantify the robustness of different systems (food, healthcare, social network) in the United States.
With this information, we could refine further research to focus on those variables (or attributes) which have a more significant correlation with our response variables (mental health), and are identified as being less robust (greater deviation during the pandemic)

### Data
The data sets used:
* National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH):
https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2019-nsduh-2019-ds0001
* National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS):
https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-mental-health-services-survey-2019-n-mhss-2019-ds0001
* Household Pulse Survey (HPS CDC)
Anxiety and Depression (A&D)
https://data.cdc.gov/d/8pt5-q6wp
* Reduced Access to Care (RAC)
https://data.cdc.gov/d/xb3p-q62w
These datasets provide information on mental health responses (anxiety and depression) and access to mental health care during the pandemic.
* Food Environment Atlas (FEA):
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/
This dataset has more than 280 variables describing the “food environment” within the United States, from acreage of crop types by county, to access to a variety of food sources by county.

### Code
Code files used to complete this project:
* JADESOUND_STATS.py
* stat_abr.py

### Minutes
A directory of all team minutes for this project.  Team minutes are documantation of team meetings and what was accomplished druing that meeting.
Every minute was documented and stored in this directory.

### Gantt Charts
There are two gantt charts for this project.  A preliminary and final gantt chart.
The purpose of the gantt chart is to assing task and keep group members accountable.
The preliminary gantt chart was created at the beginning of this project.
The final gantt chart was made at the end to accurately reflect on what task were done, who did them, and when they were completed .

### Stats
Directory full of our statistical analysis and plots

### Slides & Presentation Video
A slide show and a silent four minute presentation video of our slide show were created to communicate our findings.
The four minute video will be used to present our findings to the class during our final exam period.

### Report
This is our technical report.  This report includes a thorough analysis of our findings through the use of stats, graphical elements, and discussions.

### Reflection
This is our groups written reflection on how the final project went.

### Evaluations
Evaluations are conducted indivuadully by group mebers to report the efforts made by individuals and the group.
There are three evalutions for this project.  A self, peer, and team process evaluation.

### Ideas
Flie describing our reseach process and ideas that we tried through out the project.
